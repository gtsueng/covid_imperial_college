From the groups of outputs defined: output type (Report, Preprint, Published Article, Code); non-peer reviewed and peer reviewed and open access status (CC-BY Gold, free access) a pattern can be seen. Between Week 1 \u2013 Week 5 the outputs were entirely Reports published CC-BY. As Reports continued to be released, they were joined by Preprints in Week 6 \u2013 Week 8, also published either Gold CC-BY or under a specific preprint server licence permitting free access. From Week 9, Published Articles in journals began to appear with a mix of Gold OA outputs and introducing free access to the set. In Week 12, Code emerges for the first time as an output. From the introduction of Preprints in Week 6 and Published Articles in Week 9 we can also see the types of articles being produced; Research outputs in the form of Preprints being first seen, followed by further Research and Editorial content following in Published Articles. Later in Week 12 we see the first emergence of \u2018Other\u2019 article types \u2013 clinical guidelines and clinical education outputs. The open access status of outputs seems largely linked to their output type. 100% of the outputs were freely available at the time of writing, but 29% (12 outputs) of them were not published with licenses that guarantee this in perpetuity. This 29% are all Published Articles in subscription journals that the publisher has made free to read. There are no reuse rights associated with this. All of the rest of the outputs- Reports, Preprints and Code are open access either by a CC-BY licence or the preprint server\u2019s licence to host the article. Of the platforms disseminating these outputs, 34% are published by Imperial\u2019s repository Spiral, with a following 27% published by other repositories and preprint servers.

Using estimates of underlying infection prevalence in Wuhan at the end of January derived from testing of passengers on repatriation flights to Japan and Germany, we adjusted the estimates of CFR from either the early epidemic in Hubei Province, or from cases reported outside mainland China, to obtain estimates of the overall CFR in all infections (asymptomatic or symptomatic) of approximately 1% (95% confidence interval 0.5%-4%). It is important to note that the differences in these estimates does not reflect underlying differences in disease severity between countries. CFRs seen in individual countries will vary depending on the sensitivity of different surveillance systems to detect cases of differing levels of severity and the clinical care offered to severely ill cases. All CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously at the current time as the sensitivity of surveillance of both deaths and cases in mainland China is unclear.

Between Week 1 \u2013 Week 5 the outputs were entirely Reports published CC-BY. As Reports continued to be released, they were joined by Preprints in Week 6 \u2013 Week 8, also published either Gold CC-BY or under a specific preprint server licence permitting free access. From Week 9, Published Articles in journals began to appear with a mix of Gold OA outputs and introducing free access to the set. In Week 12, Code emerges for the first time as an output. From the introduction of Preprints in Week 6 and Published Articles in Week 9 we can also see the types of articles being produced; Research outputs in the form of Preprints being first seen, followed by further Research and Editorial content following in Published Articles. Later in Week 12 we see the first emergence of \u2018Other\u2019 article types \u2013 clinical guidelines and clinical education outputs. The open access status of outputs seems largely linked to their output type. 100% of the outputs were freely available at the time of writing, but 29% (12 outputs) of them were not published with licenses that guarantee this in perpetuity. This 29% are all Published Articles in subscription journals that the publisher has made free to read. There are no reuse rights associated with this.

Using estimates of underlying infection prevalence in Wuhan at the end of January derived from testing of passengers on repatriation flights to Japan and Germany, we adjusted the estimates of CFR from either the early epidemic in Hubei Province, or from cases reported outside mainland China, to obtain estimates of the overall CFR in all infections (asymptomatic or symptomatic) of approximately 1% (95% confidence interval 0.5%-4%). It is important to note that the differences in these estimates does not reflect underlying differences in disease severity between countries. CFRs seen in individual countries will vary depending on the sensitivity of different surveillance systems to detect cases of differing levels of severity and the clinical care offered to severely ill cases. All CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously at the current time as the sensitivity of surveillance of both deaths and cases in mainland China is unclear.
